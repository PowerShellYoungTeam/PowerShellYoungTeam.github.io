## Great PoSH Learning Resources

This blog post I plan to stick some resources to things that have really helped my understanding, which will be mostly links to other blogs, Social media accounts, Github users and repos, leanring resoucres , etc...

Actually, first one! How to setup a blog in Github pages!

check out Chad Baldwin's simple blog Bootstrap, it's actaully quite sweet, he has a github repo that sets up the barebones for you!
